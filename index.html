								<p><strong>Generating Dog Images: </strong><u>Python, Tensorflow, Keras</u></p> 
								<p>A recent Kaggle competition made by the Kaggle team to use generative methods to create pictures of dogs that have never been taken by a camera before. 
									Generative adversarial networks, introduced by Ian Goodfellow, allow this by having a neural network called the generator that takes 
									a random uniformly distributed number vector as input then outputing an image which is taken into another neural network called the 
									discriminator along with real pictures from training data and tries to distinguish them as real and fake. There are more details to this where I will
									attempt to explain as much as possible in my Kaggle 
									<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cmalla94/dcgan-generating-dog-images-with-tensorflow" target="_blank">kernal</a>
									which is still a work in progress as there is month to go in the competition.

							<p>In this section I highlighted my personal <br> non-technical skills that I believe your <br> company can benifit from.</p>

							<!--Three soft skills-->
							<p><strong>Adaptibility</strong></p>
							<p>
								I have worked in various jobs from a convienience store and sales jobs to a small (ClearDent), medium-sized (Plexia)
								and even large (Sierra Wireless) tech companies. Focusing on the tech companies, the environments were different as 
								one of them is an open environment with an agile methodology collaborating with fellow team members where projects
								have strict company conventions that must be followed in contrast to an environemnt where I work in a cubicle 
								independently with the freedom and responsibility to reasearch on promising technoligies for accomplishing a project, 
								developing a solution and deploying it to production. Personally I am capable of working with a team and independently 
								with a preference for a blend of both. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>Quick Learner</strong></p>
							<p>
								Though I listed only 6 languages and technoliges I have worked with many more depending on the task at hand. I like 
								to learn new tools and research on the benifits as well as the tradeoffs so I am able determine the best approach when 
								given a new problem to solve. I learn quickly whether it a new language, an integration software or another Javascript library. 
								I have demonstrated this through coursework where I transition from Python for a Machine Learning class to R for Data Mining and 
								Intro to Data Science classes then back to Python for Computational Data Science class. I was also capable of this at work by picking 
								up a new language like C# for development at Plexia and building ETL pipelines using SSIS and SSRS at Sierra Wireless. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
							<p>
								As an introvert I wasn't always great at talking with new people or open to the idea of it until, through persistence, got into a 
								cellphone sales job at OSL where I was required to get out of my comfort zone and engage with customers in order to push sales and
								exceed the quota. I have placed top 3 in the Western Canadian district for sales and also top 5 in the customer satisfaction working 
								as a support technician at ClearDent. I communicate clearly and effectively when volunteering as a mentor at Canada Learning Code, 
								speaking in meetings at work and networking at Vancouver's data science meetup group where we people present past 
								Kaggle competitions.
